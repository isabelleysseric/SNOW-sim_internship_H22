## Collada

(COLLAborative Design Activity) is a format for 3D object.  

The different files in this folder allow you to integrate each shape as a model in a simulator like Gazebo, Gazebo Ignition or other.  
These files were created with the Blender software by exporting its file as a 3D object in Collada format, that is to say with the extension dae.  

<br>

**Types of models**:
- Fluids dynamics
- Particle dynamics
- Soft body dynamics

**List of models**:
- Ground
- Each object
